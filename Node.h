/** This is the class definition of Node.
* The node should be imagined as a small cube which contains some sort of data.
* This node must have 6 connections, which all connect to adjacent blocks.
* 
* For the sake of this not being a total pain, I'm going to inherit this class
* for the data object I want for any sort of project.
*
* Because of that, I'll be able to have the node connections, and whatever
* complex data storage structure I'll choose in the vast uncertain future.
